Savant models trained to do one task effectively bound together by the logician:
+ Quickly train new rewards
+ Can retain previous known info
+ Decent way to combine logician (if this is true I should do this)
- Confusing to implement

Novelty trained:
+ No strict reward function
- improved novelty bus requires a basis of training so they don't just die

Genetically trained:
+ One of the best for learning / novelty
- AI's may become cohesive and miss a path that could have been explored
- Still requires a defined reward function

Deep Q:
+ Effective survival and choosing of tasks
- Requires a strict reward function
