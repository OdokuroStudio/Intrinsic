‚ú® *Imagine the features of Minecraft: open world, procedural generation, fully destructible voxel environments... but open source, without Java, easily extensible in [Lua](https://www.lua.org), and with the modern [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs for AI agent research...

[Craftium](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a fully open-source platform for creating fast, rich, and diverse **single and multi-agent** environments. Craftium is based on the amazing [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) voxel game engine and the popular [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs. Craftium forks Minetest to support:

- Connecting to Craftium's Python process (sending environment's data and receiving action commands)
- Executing Craftium actions as keyboard and mouse controls.
- Extesions to the Lua API for creating RL environments and tasks.
- Minetest's client/server synchronization for slow agents (e.g., LLMs or VLMs).

üìö Craftium's documentation can be found [here](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

üìë If you use craftium in your projects or research please consider [citing](#citing-craftium) the project, and don't hesitate to let us know what you have created using the library! ü§ó

## Features ‚ú®

- **Super extensible üß©:** Minetest is built with modding in mind! The game engine is completely extensible using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) programming language. Easily create mods to implement the environment that suits the needs of your research! See [environments](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/) for a showcase of what is possible with craftium.

- **Extensive documentation üìö:** Craftium extensively [documents](https://craftium.readthedocs.io) how to [use](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/) existing [environments](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments) and [create](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/creating-envs/) new ones. The documentation also includes a low-level [reference](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/) of the exported Python classes and gymnasium [Wrappers](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wrappers/), [extensions to the Lua API](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua_functions/), and [code examples](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua_env_cookbook/). Moreover, Craftium greatly benefits from existing Minetest documentation like the [wiki](https://wiki.minetest.net/Main_Page), [reference](https://api.minetest.net/), and [modding book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/basics/getting_started.html).

- **Modern RL API ü§ñ:** Craftium slightly modifies Mintest to communicate with Python, and implements the well-known [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)'s [Env](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) API. This opens the door to a huge number of existing tools and libraries compatible with this API, such as [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io) or [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) (check [examples](#examples-) section!).

- **Fully open source ü§†:** Craftium is based on the Minetest and Gymnasium, both open-source projects.

- **No more Java ‚ö°:** The Minecraft game is written in Java, not a very friendly language for clusters and high-performance applications. Contrarily, Minetest is written in C++, much more friendly for clusters, and highly performant!

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

First, clone craftium using the `--recurse-submodules` flag (**important**: the flag fetches submodules needed by the library) and `cd` into the project's main directory:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mikelma/craftium.git # if you prefer ssh: git@github.com:mikelma/craftium.git
cd craftium
```

`craftium` depends on [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest), which in turn, depends on a series of libraries that we need to install. Minetest's repo contains [instructions](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/compiling/linux.md) on how to setup the build environment for many Linux distros (and  [MacOS](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/compiling/macos.md)). In Ubuntu/Debian the following command installs all the required libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install g++ make libc6-dev cmake libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libsqlite3-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libjsoncpp-dev libzstd-dev libluajit-5.1-dev gettext libsdl2-dev
```

Additionally, `craftium` requires Python's header files to build a dedicated Python module implemented in C (`mt_server`):

```bash
sudo apt install libpython3-dev
```

Then, check that `setuptools` is updated and run the installation command in the craftium repo's directory:

```bash
pip install -U setuptools
```

and,

```bash
pip install .
```

This last command should compile minetest, install python dependencies, and, finally, craftium. If the installation process fails, please consider submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/mikelma/craftium/issues).

## Getting started üí°

Craftium implements [Gymnasium's](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) [`Env`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/) API, making it compatible with many popular reinforcement learning libraries and tools like [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) and [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).

Thanks to the mentioned API, using craftium environments is as simple as using any gymnasium environment. The example below shows the implementation of a random agent in one of the craftium's environments:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import craftium

env = gym.make("Craftium/ChopTree-v0")

observation, info = env.reset()

for t in range(100):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # get a random action
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, _info = env.step(action)

    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()

env.close()
```

Training a CNN-based agent using PPO is as simple as:

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common import logger
import gymnasium as gym
import craftium

env = gym.make("Craftium/ChopTree-v0")

model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, verbose=1)

new_logger = logger.configure("logs-ppo-agent", ["stdout", "csv"])
model.set_logger(new_logger)
model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000)

env.close()
```

This example trains a CNN-based agent for 10K timesteps in the `Craftium/ChopTree-v0` environment using PPO. Additionally, we set up a custom logger that records training statistics to a CSV file inside the `logs-ppo-agent/` directory.

Craftium is not only limited to "typical" RL scenarios, its versatility makes it the ideal platform for meta-RL, open-ended learning, continual and lifelong RL, or unsupervised environment design. As a showcase, Craftium provides open-world and procedurally generated tasks (see [environments](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/) for more info).

This code snippet initializes a procedurally generated dungeon environment with 5 rooms and a maximum number of 4 monsters per room:
```python
env, map_str = craftium.make_dungeon_env(
    mapgen_kwargs=dict(
        n_rooms=5,
        max_monsters_per_room=5,
    ),
    return_map_str=True,
)
print(map_str.split("-")[1])
```

## Examples ü§ì
