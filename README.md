# Intrinsic

Intrinsic is a neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence implementation to play the game of Minecraft.
This project aims to map symbolic nodes with neural nodes in order to allow the following.
- A more dynamic reward function to prevent reward stagnation.
- Simpler viewing into the inner workings of the neural network.
- Logical chains of reasoning to allow the network to factually "know".

Using Deep Q-learning combined with symbolic logic this project aims to develop,
an AI to discover its own rules in minecraft and learn to effectivly play the game.
